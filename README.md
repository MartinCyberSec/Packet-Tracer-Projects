🚀 Packet Tracer Projects
📌 Logical and Physical Mode Exploration
This project dives into the differences between Logical Mode and Physical Mode in Cisco Packet Tracer. The goal is to understand how network configurations operate logically versus how devices are physically arranged in a network environment.

🔹 Key Focus Areas:
Setting up network topologies in Logical Mode

Visualizing physical placement of networking equipment

Exploring how real-world constraints affect network design

🌐 Simple Network Activity
This project focuses on building a basic network setup in Packet Tracer, emphasizing essential concepts such as IP addressing, device connectivity, and basic routing.

🔹 Key Focus Areas:
Configuring routers and switches

Assigning IP addresses and testing connectivity

Implementing a simple peer-to-peer communication scenario

These projects are excellent for hands-on learning and reinforcing cybersecurity principles within networking.
